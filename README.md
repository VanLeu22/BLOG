# Navigating the Cloud: A Newcomer's Journey with Azure and AWS

## Cloud-y, with a chance of ... Beanstalk?

Entering the world of cloud computing as a career switcher is like stepping off the bus in a bustling, high-tech metropolis with towering skyscrapers of jargon and a labyrinth of services. When I first decided to dive into this industry, I felt both exhilarated and overwhelmed. My journey began with Azure (as part of Josh Madakor’s Cybersecurity Course), and it felt like a welcoming tour from a polished architect who knew exactly how to guide me through every corridor.

## First Impressions: Azure, the Sophisticated Architect

Azure was my first introduction to cloud computing. From the moment I opened the portal, I was greeted with a clean, intuitive interface reminiscent of Microsoft products I’d used for years. It was like meeting an elegantly dressed engineer with blueprints and a projector, who could visualize infrastructure with precision and clarity. I could tell that Azure prioritized organization and user experience.

Navigating through Azure felt like gliding through a well-designed architectural marvel. Page after page you’re presented with the same comfortable layout as you dive deeper and deeper into the system. Need to back out a bit because you took a wrong turn? A simple ‘X’ in the top corner returns you to the previously explored landscape you just traveled through. This seems trivial, but I for one hate having to click back on the browser to reload the previous page.

Each service had a logical name—Virtual Machines were, well, Virtual Machines. Storage was called Blob Storage. No guessing games. No cryptic acronyms. Everything was clearly labeled, and the integration with other Microsoft products like Active Directory (which now is called EntraID, but I’ll get to that) made it feel like I was using one cohesive suite rather than a collection of disconnected tools.

But that doesn’t mean Azure is perfect. As Joshua Olivo (member of The Cyber Range Community on Skool) points out, 

> "Azure is pretty easy to pick up and use, but Microsoft sure loves to keep us on our toes with constant product name changes—just when you finally remember what something's called, they rename it!"

This reflects the dynamic nature of Azure, where even with its user-friendly design, there's an ongoing learning curve due to updates and changes. The Active Directory name change to EntraID highlights that. Joshua O. also notes,

> "The Azure portal is generally user-friendly, though it sometimes needs a good ol' refresh when it decides to be quirky. Overall, it’s a solid platform, but navigating the occasional UI hiccup is just part of the adventure!"

This acknowledgment of Azure’s minor quirks doesn't diminish its overall appeal but adds a human touch to the experience, akin to understanding the complexities behind a well-designed building.

## Enter AWS: The Rugged Explorer

But I knew I couldn’t limit myself to just one cloud provider, so I decided to plunge into the unknown and enrolled in a three-day AWS cloud practitioner bootcamp, ready to expand my horizons. AWS is undeniably the behemoth in the industry, and I was eager to learn from the so-called pioneer of cloud services.

From the moment I opened the AWS Management Console, it felt like meeting a rugged explorer—a utility belt-clad adventurer with every tool imaginable, but no map to show me where to start. The interface felt dated and cluttered, more functional than friendly. The product naming conventions were a language all their own. EC2? S3? Lambda? Aurora? Redshift? Glue? It was as if this explorer spoke exclusively in acronyms, expecting me to decode them on the fly.

AWS is powerful, no doubt about it. It’s like meeting someone who has a solution for every possible scenario, but you have to dig through their backpack to find the right tool. It felt overwhelming to navigate the vast ecosystem of services, and I found myself wishing for the neat, organized compartments of Azure’s toolbox. The naming conventions were a particularly tough hurdle—it was like being handed a map with no legend, forcing me to memorize a series of cryptic codes just to find my way around.

## The Bootcamp Challenge and a Surprising Victory

Three days of intensive AWS training felt like scaling a mountain with the rugged explorer. There were moments when I questioned if I’d ever understand how to use the myriads of services at my disposal. Yet, somehow, against all odds, I passed the AWS certification exam on the first try. I was stunned. The bootcamp had crammed a colossal amount of information into my brain, and I walked away with a deep respect for the sheer power and flexibility AWS offers.

However, despite this surprising victory, I didn’t walk away feeling like I’d found my cloud “home.” AWS felt like an adventure—a thrilling, complex journey that required resourcefulness and endurance. I could appreciate its vastness and versatility, but it still felt like uncharted wilderness.

## The Verdict: Why Azure Still Has My Heart (For Now)

Despite my newfound appreciation for AWS, Azure still feels like home. It’s not just about familiarity—it’s about the experience. Azure’s sophisticated architect persona resonates with me. Its user-friendly interface and logical product naming help me stay focused on building solutions rather than deciphering names. Its seamless integration with other Microsoft products makes everything feel cohesive and efficient.

Yes, I appreciate AWS’s ruggedness and versatility. I admire its global reach and the seemingly endless array of tools at its disposal. But for someone new to the industry, who is still finding their footing, Azure’s strategic and polished approach offers a level of comfort that AWS doesn’t—at least not yet.

## Looking Forward: An Evolving Journey

I’m not closing the door on AWS. Far from it. I see its potential and recognize its power, and I fully intend to keep exploring its expansive terrain. But for now, Azure’s sleek portal is a breath of fresh air compared to the dense forest of AWS’s console. While AWS felt like navigating uncharted wilderness, Azure was like walking through a well-lit architectural masterpiece and making it my cloud companion of choice.

And who knows? Maybe one day, I’ll look at AWS’s rugged explorer with less intimidation and more admiration. After all, every adventurer needs a good architect, and every architect could learn a thing or two from an explorer.

As for Google Cloud, I have no experience there yet, so that chapter remains unwritten. But the cloud computing journey is far from over, and I’m eager to see where the winds will take me next.
